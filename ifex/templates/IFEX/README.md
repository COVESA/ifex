# templates/IFEX

This directory contains templates that generate IFEX - in other words probably
used in translators from another format to IFEX.  Other template directories
usually generate other formats _from_ IFEX.

Specifically, these templates are likely to generate IFEX Core IDL, but some of
them may be designed to generate other Layer Types.
