#
# Grammar for Lark parser, derived from protobuf specification at:
# https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/proto3-spec
#
# Design notes:
# -------------
# There seemed to be not a single official and canonical grammar
# file, only the definitions provided in the protobuf3 specification.
# 
# There were also other parser examples mentioned/linked at protobuf.com:
# https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf.com/tree/main/examples 
# Those grammars don't seem to use the exact same names as the ones in the
# specification.  I did not find a Lark-based one to reuse.  The other grammars
# could have been reused, with a different parser framework, and/or after rework.
# In the end, taking grammar from the specification and writing it in a Lark
# way felt like an equivalent or lower effort.
#
#
# Grammar format:
# ---------------
# 
# Here we rewrite each rule in Lark syntax.  It tries to follow the EBNF from
# the specification closely, but with the following comments: 
#
#  - The original rule names use CamelCase but they have here been modified to
#    fit common Lark naming conventions: 
#    - Composite rules are here converted to _lowercase_ only!
#    - Terminals (Tokens) are convertd to UPPERCASE only
#  - Some composite rules in the original grammar can be simplified
#  into a single regexp Terminal definition.  This is done in some
#  areas to reduce the complexity and depth of the rule set.
#  If the regexp replaces the original rule completely, then it has been named
#  as the original rule but UPPERCASE (which is the lark convention for
#  terminal/regexp definitons).
#
#  - Next, we have added ? questionmark to some rules. This is a Lark feature
#  that "inlines" that rule/token - if it has only one value (which is very
#  common for many rules)  so that we don't need to iterate over it 
#
#  - There can be a few additional minor tweaks/changes to better suit the Lark
#  principlesl 
#
#
# Added grammar rules for Lark
# ----------------------------
#
#  The way Lark works is that only rules and terminal/tokens are kept in the
#  resulting parse-tree.  If a statement matches an explicit string specified
#  in a rule, those words are considered 'syntax' that was matched to identify
#  the statement type.  Those words won't be stored in the resulting parse tree.
# 
#  Example for import:  A EBNF like this:
#
#  >  import: "import" ("weak" | "public")? strlit ";"
#
#  The word "import" is thrown away because the resulting statement type (the
#  name import before the colon) will be stored.  That's expected, and we don't
#  need the word "import" to also be remembered.
#
#  The strlit will be stored with the token, because it is the content that
#  matches a separate rule.
# 
#  However, the rule will match if `weak` or `public` was mentioned but
#  since those are explicit words, "syntax" it won't store which explicit word
#  was used. `weak` and `public` would be matched and then thrown away.  Since
#  weak/public are keywords with semantic meaning here so we need the information
#  to be carried into the parsed result.
#
#  We need therefore to separately name a token or rule for the recognition of
#  weak/public so that the information is stored in the parse tree.  (Lark also
#  provides a mechanism called an "alias" to achieve the same -- see Lark
#  documentation)
#
#  We use a name starting with `x_` or `X_` in cases where we added a
#  new/additional rule to the grammar from the specification.
#
#
# Grammar organization
# --------------------
#
# For each item there is a line "from spec: " which is the exact EBNF
# definition provided by the specification.  After that follows the Lark
# grammar rule(s).  Sections (titles) of the specification have also been kept
# for each area.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Reminder EBNF syntax:
# |   alternation
# ()  grouping
# []  option (zero or one time)
# {}  repetition (any number of times)
#
# Reminder Lark syntax:
# See Lark documentation, but it is similar to regular expressions for
# grouping `()`, alternation `|` option `?` and repetition `*` / `+`

# NOTE: I don't think we can distinguish between message and enum
# types atm.  The syntax is the same, and they are used in
# similar/same places?  If required, cross referencing the enumname

# And similarly messagename as used in a 'message' definition.

# ...so we may as well inline them

# Constant 
# --------

# from spec:  constant = fullIdent | ( [ "-" | "+" ] intLit ) | ( [ "-" | "+" ] floatLit ) | strLit | boolLit | messageValue
# comment: The spec looks buggy because intLit already allows for a - sign in front of it, so why not allow a + sign on all intlits also?
# => We deviate from spec slightly here, because a prefixed "+" is unlikely to happen in input anyway:
# comment2: Why can't a constant be a Hexadecimal literal??

# comment: We have to capture the actual type that is used - easiest is to match them with regexp.  It's not enough since we also have composite rules messagetype and enumtype to take care of - so an extra X_BUILTINTYPE added, and it is also prioritized (.1) over messagetype which might otherwise match
# NOTE: 'messagetype' and 'enumtype' are defined identically, and also only used to define 'type' here.
# Therefore, it is easier to combine them => let's call it DEFINEDTYPE
