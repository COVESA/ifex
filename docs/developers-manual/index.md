This manual is useful primarily for implementation of new IFEX tools, but sometimes also for people who use the tools and then develop software based on the output that was generated to/from IFEX. Before reading the developers' manual, make sure you have read the [IFEX Core IDL specification](../specification/index.md) and [FAQ](../faq/index.md).
