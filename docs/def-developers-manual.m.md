# Mapping documents

By "mapping" we mean to describe how we may interpret and ultimately translate IFEX to or from another interface description environment, or a particular output format (computing environment, protocol, programming language, etc.).  It can be such things as listing the "features" of IFEX and seeing how we may implement those features in the target environment (or the opposite direction, listing the features of the other environment and how IFEX can meet them).

General documents describe our general strategy for approaching mappings.

Individual documents describe particular target (or source) standards.
