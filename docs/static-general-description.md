# FEATURES
The format supports the following features

* **Namespaces**  
  Logical grouping of methods, events, properties, and defined data types that can be nested.

* **Interfaces**  
  Logical grouping of methods, events, properties, and defined data types that are intended to be exposed as a 'public' (externally usable) interface from a software component.

* **Methods**  
  A function or remote-procedure-call, sent to and executed by a particular targeted component (server). Methods can have input and output parameters, as well as separate return-parameters, and errors.

* **Rich type system**
  Named data types that can be enumerations, structs or typedefs, and collections (arrays) of types, and each of those types can be nested.  Type aliases are supported, and constraints such as a limited value-range (work in progress).

* **Events**  
  A fire-and-forget call/message, sent to or invoked on zero or more subscribing instances. The Event has no return a value and does not guarantee delivery (refer to target-dependent details).

* **Data Properties**  
  An observable shared state object that can be read and set, and which is available to all\* subscribing entities.
  (\*individual access control rules are of course possible to apply in the target environment) .

* **Layered architecture and Deployment files**  
  IFEX Core IDL is designed to be a fundamental format for describing all sorts of software interfaces.  Interface descriptions should be as generic as possible, meaning the same interface description can be reused in a completely different environment.  The IFEX concept adds on a layered architecture that adds deployment-specific data to an interface definition so that it can avoid cluttering the core IDL.  Other composable features are likely to be created using the generic layering concept.  This separation of interface and deployment was pioneered by **Franca IDL** and IFEX continues and extends the principle.

## Features that are not included _in the core IDL_, but worth describing:

* **Service**

This current version of the IFEX Core IDL has removed the "service:" keyword but the concept of a service should still be defined in terms of the interfaces the service provides.  (See next chapter).

* **Signal**

IFEX Core IDL does not include the name Signal but supports both **Events** and **Properties** that do cover two different interpretations of the word signal.  See next chapter for a more detailed analysis.

## Feature concept details

### Target Environment

- Target Environment is a catch-all term to indicate the context and environment of those artifacts that are generated from source IDL.
- For each type of output result from a generator or conversion tool, there will be environment-specific details to consider, and in the documentation we often refer to all of those as simply the "target environment".
- The term simply signifies any and all things that are unique about that environment.

For example:
- The chosen programming language in the case of code-generation tools.
- The chosen communication protocol or binding technology.
- Any details pertaining to other levels of software technology that is being targeted.  (For example if HTTP is an applicable protocol to use then details of transport layer security (TLS) would apply to that environment, whereas for other protocols it might not).

Please note that in the text, "target-environment dependent", may sometimes be shortened to simply target-dependent and similar simplifications may occur.


### Namespace

- A Namespace is a way to separate definitions inside named groups.
- Namespaces are used to ensure that local names will not clash with identically named items in other namespace.
- Namespaces affect visibility, in other words what objects can be _seen_ or _reached_ from within a part of a program.
- Namespaces can contain other Namespaces, creating a hierarchy.
- How visibility/reachability is handled _might_ be specific to the target language or environment, but IFEX expects the following behavior to be the normal one unless there are very good reasons for exceptions:
  - Items within different (non-parent) namespaces are isolated from each other unless otherwise specified, and these frequently used hierarchy rules apply:  Everything within a child namespace can see and reach items in any of its parent namespaces.  For non-parent relationship, it is required to either specify an item using a fully-qualified "path" through the namespace hierarchy, or to make a statement of reference or inclusion of another namespaces into the current namespace.

## Interface

- Generally, Interface is a broad term.  In IFEX core IDL we concerned with functional software interfaces, nothing related to hardware, electrical or mechanical.
- An IFEX Interface is like a specialization of the Namespace concept, but used specifically to group things that are intended to be the externally visible (a.k.a. public) interface of a software component that defines its interface using the IFEX file.
- Design note: It would have been possible to generalize even further and to say that "an Interface is just a Namespace".  In that case, a layer would have been used to indicate which Namespace object(s) shall be considered one that holds the primary objects of our 'exported' interface.  But since the purpose of the IDL is primarily to define an interface it seems appropriate to give it special status by giving it its own keyword in the IDL itself.  Also, the nature of "visibility of objects" and "avoiding name clashes" (main reason for Namespace) is subtly different from the nature of "which objects do we consider being part of our outwardly displayed interface".
- In this definition, the  Interface is not itself a Namespace (in terms of object visibility) but it must be defined within a Namespace.  All the Interface's objects belong to the parent Namespace of the Interface.
- An Interface can contain all things a Namespace can contain, except another Interface (no nesting).
- An IFEX **Interface** is often defined by a collection of **Methods**, but could also expose functionality through **Event**s and data **Properties**.  The interface might also include variables, constants, method-arguments, types, observable data-items and events that are required by the client using the interface.  That can be done for clarity, but from visibility standpoint it is identical to including them in the immediate parent Namespace.
- The IFEX core IDL strives to usable in all areas of a computing system.  The interface definition therefore does not define details around communication hardware, implementation language, data-communication protocols, bit-encoding and in-memory layouts etc.  Such information is however added through supplementary information in the mappings and tools that consume the interface description.
- All Methods/Properties/Events defined or referred to by an Interface are required to be within the same Namespace, i.e. it is not possible to build an Interface by referring to Methods that have been defined in different Namespaces.

### Method

- A method is a function with a (mandatory) name, plus a set of (optional) **input parameters**, **output parameters**, **return parameters** and **error conditions**.
- Like most other objects, a Method is always defined in the context of a Namespace, but that is often as a result of being within the context of an Interface within a Namespace.

### Errors

- An IFEX Error definition is a condition that can appear while (attempting to) execute a given Method.
- An error is defined by referencing a **datatype** that define the type of information that shall be communicated when an error occurs.  Enumeration types are common, but it could be any defined type.
- There can be _more than one_ error, each with its own datatype, defined for a method.  
- NOTE: Don't mistake this for what most programming environments describe, which is to define a single enumeration, or structured/variant type, where each returned _value_ may indicate a different "error".  What IFEX provides is the possibility of defining multiple different error returns, each with their own name and type (similar to multiple input or output-variables in a function).  Through overlays, that enables efficiently separating business-logic errors (that are known when the interface is defined), from transport errors (that are only known later, when a particular target environment has been selected).  The difference is subtle and of course the generated code might be required to combine the information into a single struct/variant/union type because of limitations, but the difference is that it can now be done at the deployment stage, and not at the interface definition stage.

- It is not specified by IFEX core IDL how errors are propagated to the caller of a function - that translation is target language/environment specific.  It may be done using a return or output parameter in one programming language and using Exception-handling in another.  Network communication protocols may implement their own error-condition side-channels or other methods.

### Event

- An Event is a time-sensitive communication with _fire-and-forget_ behavior, sent between parts in the distributed system.
- A IFEX Event can carry multiple pieces of data with it, each of which can use an arbitrary data type.
- A IFEX Event definition looks similar to a Method but with some differences in definition and behavior:
  - An Event has a name, and optionally a set of parameters that are distributed with the event, each having a name and a datatype.  This mimics a Method signature.  Just like a method, parameters are defined as **input parameters**. It is viewed from the perspective of the _receiver_ of the event.
  - An Event can **not** have a Return type, nor any out-parameters.
  - An Event may have **Error**s defined but with limited effect.  Since the expected behavior is "fire and forget", the usage of Error is likely to only be to report very fundamental errors, such as the network protocol returning an error because the connection was closed, etc.  (Note that such low-level Errors would normally not appear in a generic and reusable interface description, but in that case be added when specific deployment-details are layered on to the definition).
- _Fire-and-forget_ expected behavior means that on the IFEX semantics level it is _not expected_ to be a guaranteed delivery.  It is in reality decided by the target environment mapping whether an Event is sent over a reliable or unreliable transport, but in either case, there is **no reply** defined for an Event.  When an interface is designed it shall use a **Method** if reliability is expected.  In the case of a Method, a return value would indicate that the information was received.

**Avoiding event confusion:**

- An IFEX **Event** is not a persistent data item, and thus has no built-in concepts of active-low/high, level or edge-trigger, rising/falling edge, etc. (other than what its name and documentation indicates\*\*).  It is to expressly indicate a particular thing "has happened".  It happened "at this point in time", and is communicated as nearly as possible to the time of the happening.

- An IFEX **Event** is a separate and _expressly defined_ object in the interface description. It should be used for something central to the "business-logic" of the interface.  It is not to be mixed up with lower level "happenings" in a system that do not need to be expressly defined.  Events shall not be confused with messages that are _automatically_ sent by some target environment directly, either that they are always done (hidden as part of that implementation) or  _as a result of_ the already encoded behavior of other objects already in the IDL.  

    - The most obvious example is this:  In many systems, subscribing to changes of an observable data **Property** may trigger something that the target environment might call "update events", but those are a consequence of the behavior of the observable Property.   Assuming that the target-mapping is generating both sides of the communication, then these do not need explicit Event objects in the IDL itself.  It can sometimes be difficult to draw this distinction, but remember that if these low-level behaviors can be automatically generated during code-generation as a consequence of some object that is already in the interface (plus sometimes, some additional layered information), then it is not necessary to provide more information to the code-generators for them to succeed.  Those low-level mechanisms are normally decided by the particular data protocol or target environment and would then not be reusable in another context.  Since they are automatically generated from other objects (Property for example), there is no need to provide additional information in the IDL about them.  The strategy should be: Avoid overlapping definitions in the core IDL, and let the target environment mappings decide what the auto-generated result of that input information is (as long as it follows the _generally expected behavior_ described in this specification.   A Property is described as "observable" in the core IFEX IDL.  Most of the time, let the target mapping decide how that observability is implemented, and avoid modeling explicit events for that purpose.  That said, in certain cases, when auto-translating from another IDL description that already have explicit events of that nature, then it might not be possible to follow this guideline, but just try where possible to lift the interface level to objects with more built-in semantic meaning, such as Method and Property.

- \*\* Design tip:  If there is a need to model On/Off events, to avoid duplicating each one into two different Events -> give the event a single name and transfer a boolean as argument: FooState(bool) where the true/false value indicates the on/off state.  Another option might be to define an observable boolean data **Property** and use the target environment's Pub/Sub capability to get updates on its state.  (Depending on the details of the target environment, the latter might also give reliability guarantees that Events do not have).

- Conceptually, an Event can be sent from client to server or from server to client(\*).
(\*) TO CLARIFY: Shall the direction of an event be defined, and how?

- \*\* If some events are to be transferred as a "broadcast" (from server to all clients) when other events would be addressed uniquely to particular client(s), then define this difference as extra information in a deployment model / target mapping.  It is not specified in the interface description.

### Property

- A **Property** is an observable data item.  It belongs in an **Interface**, has a canonical name in addition to possible **aliases** (alternative names), and a data type.
- A Property is defined as a single item but the data type could be an arbitrary data type, including large and composite data types.
- The singular nature of a property suggests that it is generally expected behavior is that its value shall updated and communicated as an atomic operation, (it is either fully updated or not at all).
- The available features for update and communication are target-environment specific, but the most common expectation is that a Property can be updated and _observed_, meaning that a client can call a method to get or set the current value of the property (with appropriate access control rules) and often also _subscribe_ to be notified of when the value of a property was changed for any reason.
- N.B. In some other language definitions this type of item is called an **Attribute** or **Field**.
- A property can be seen as analogous (and conceptually equal) to a Signal in the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS).

### Return values

- A Return Value specifies what is returned from a Method execution.  Although "out parameters" could serve a similar purpose, the Return Value has been given special status.  This is for convenience in some cases, but the following chapters on asynchronous methods and data streaming interfaces, the need for special meaning is clarified.
- In target mappings it is of course possible that return values might be implemented as out-parameters in some programming language, or vice versa that out-parameters are embedded into a composite return value.   On the receiving side, the items might be converted back to their original separated meaning.  Such decision depend on the capability of the target environment.
- While return-value is often traditionally used for indicating success/error, please note that the abstract Errors concept is more powerful and should often be preferred in new designs.
- Only one single return value is supported, but it can of course use any data type including composite types.
- The term Status may be used in other technologies and the meaning of return value can be seen as equivalent of status.

### Return/status communication in asynchronous vs. synchronous method calls

- In computing systems there are two main paradigms regarding invocation of a procedure/function: Blocking/synchronous vs. Non-blocking/asynchronous.

  - In a blocking/synchronous environment, the client invokes an operation ("calls a function") and will halt until the operation is completed ("the function returns") and then continue its own execution flow. When completed, a return-value (result) may be communicated back to the client.

  - In an asynchronous setup, a client can trigger the start of an operation and then continue doing other work while the method executes in parallel.  Programming languages and environments have different mechanisms for either notifying the client that the operation is finished, or for the client to ask if it is finished or, at some later point in time decide to go into a "blocking" mode and wait for the operation to finish.  In any case, the executing server may will report back the result in some manner when the operation is finished, but it could also give continuous reports as to the progress of the function ("streaming updates").

- In the IFEX core IDL, methods can only be defined _without_ defining their (synchronous/asynchronous) invocation strategy.  It is more flexible to define this separately in a deployment-model/target-mapping because it leads to interface descriptions that can be reused in a wider set of circumstances.  Perhaps it is true that some operations only are suited for one or the other, but many operations can in general be done in either a synchronous or asynchronous manner.  The desire for sync vs. async might change in new circumstances, and the availability of sync/async might also be constrained by the target environment capability. To encourage the design of widely reusable and generic interfaces, the sync/async aspect is therefore defined separate from the main IDL.  

- In all cases, an IFEX Method may define a Return Value type.  The return value can be defined for the interface description, without knowing the manner that the method will be invoked (e.g. the chosen communication protocol). IFEX-IDL-language has the unique feature of using the Return Value type to serve two different purposes in sync vs async situations:

- As discussed, the details _may_ be target-environment dependent, but we can here define the _generally expected_ behavior of the return type in a system built from a IFEX interface:  
  1. In the case of a blocking/synchronous call, the Return Value type is the value communicated _once_ after the operation completes.  
  2. In the case of a non-blocking/asynchronous call, the same defined Return Value type is also used with the difference that it _may_ be returned _multiple times_.  Using that behavior is optional and target-dependent, but if it is used then a target environment may choose to provide a regular stream of status updates while the method executes.  In each such update, a value is transferred that matches the defined Return Value type\*\*.  
  - It follows that only valid values of the Return Value type shall be returned. 

  - \*\* Design note:  This is already in itself a very powerful mechanism and should suffice in a majority of cases, but if any additional status/streaming-data functionality is required, that may of course be done by defining a data Property in the interface, whose value is used to indicate the status of the system for the executing method.  This would enable to listen (subscribe) to update to the Property, or fetch it on-demand, depending on what features the target mapping provides for Properties.  Note that there is no _formal_ way to describe the relationship between Property and Method in this design approach - it would rely on documenting the relationship in descriptions.

  - \*\*\*Design note 2: While the interface can now be defined without deciding up front about synchronous/asynchronous operation, if an async operation _may_ be expected it is still a good idea to design the return value with this in mind.  It is likely to include something to indicate that processing is under way.  For example the streaming returns during an operation might be: Started, Processing..., Processing..., Processing..., Done!"`  (Note that this, like most details, can be extended by overlays.)

- While a return value can also indicate that the operation did NOT complete successfully, the more capable **Errors** concept should not be overlooked.

- After an operation has been completed and its equivalent of "DONE" has been communicated, the function is expected to seize any further communication of the return/status type.

## Data Streams

It might be noticed that the IFEX core IDL does not seem to have an explicit type for "streaming data" type interfaces.  However, when reading the previous chapter about asynchronous methods it should be clear that there is a natural way to do it:

1. Define a method on the server, which the client would call to initiate a stream.
2. Define the method **return value** as the datatype that describes the items that are streamed. (each byte, each packet, or to whatever level of detail the stream can be subdivided).
3. When executing, the server streams continuous "updates" of this return value type for as long as the stream is open.

Note here, that the explicit separation of **Error** s from return value, which is most other programming and IDL environments fail to do, enables modeling Error information that would be returned to the client when a problem occurs, and that is completely independent of the return type that describes what the streaming data looks like.

Here we have a situation where it is likely to be known at interface-definition time how the method is intended to be used.  It is therefore recommended that the interface designer makes note of this in a comment, that the particular method indicates a streaming interface.

As described in the previous chapter, to make a method asynchronous will require a target-environment deployment layer that annotates the method to be "asynchronous".  If it is necessary, the design of that target mapping is of course free to use more explicit metadata to make it even clearer and since Layer Types are completely open for design, it could also add more information such as the data rate and exact method of streaming, and so on.

Example (not normative):
```
methods:
  - name: mymethod
    asynchronous: true
    streaming: true    # example, the layer design (i.e. not part of this IDL core specification) decides what makes sense
```
 
### Service (not a core IDL feature)

The current version of the IFEX Core IDL removed the "service:" keyword that was
in the earliest specification.  In the future a new concept may be appropriate to
add but at the moment it is expected that any definition of "service" will be
defined externally from the core IDL, and make reference to IFEX Core IDL
file(s) that describe Interfaces.

It is still worthwhile to prepare our understanding of what a service is:

- A service is a software functionality or set of functionalities that can be activated by a client. A key characteristic of a service in support of SOA is that it has low coupling to other services and strives to provide a useful function also if used independently from other services.
- In IFEX philosophy, a **Service** provides one or more **Interface**s and it is anticipated that interfaces are described using the IFEX Core IDL.
- Most likely, a service definition will only make sense together with deployment information such as the chosen target environment and technology (a specific RPC protocol, a REST-style web-service, etc.).  Therefore, it will require additional files ("layers") independent of the Interface descriptions anyhow, so leaving it out of the core IDL makes sense.. 

### Signals (not a core IDL feature)

The word Signal is interpreted by some as the _transfer_ of a _value_ associated 
with a name/id for what that value represents.  This suggests that a signal
is something happening at a point in time.  Such value transfer ought to
be semantically equivalent to single-argument Event, and is therefore supported
using Event in IFEX.  Another interpretation is that the word Signal rather represents
the underlying data item itself, independent of what time update-events are sent.
In this second case, value-transfers are defined more as a consequence of the data
changing, or a predefined frequency of update -  for example "subscribing to
changes of a Signal".  In this second interpretation the Signal is represented
by a Property in IFEX.  The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) defines "signals"
that have a name, a datatype, a unit and meaning but the transfer of data is
defined by separate protocols built on top of VSS.  In other words, VSS
typically uses the the second interpretation, and VSS Signals can then be
represented by Properties in IFEX.  (Refer to the [separate
analysis](static-vss_integration_proposal.md) of the IFEX/VSS relationship).

--------------------

# NAMESPACE VERSIONING

IFEX namespaces can have a major and minor version, specified by
`major_version` and `minor_version` keys, complemented by an additional
free format string named `version_label`.  These are defined as optional
in the core IDL, but most development processes ought to treat them as mandatory
at some point in the working process, to support management of API
compatibility between components.

There is also an optional `patch_version` number, to simplify compatibility
with other interface descriptions that use the semantic versioning principle.
(Please see the recommendation _against_ using `patch_version` in new
designs, described in the Interface Versioning chapter).

Namespace version management can be used to understand the impact of changes
on various namespace levels and how this may affect compatibility.
For general API-compatibility evaluation, the version on the **Interface**
node might be used more often, however.

Namespace versioning shall follow the Semantic Versioning principle.  Follow
the more detailed description under Interface Versioning.

Namespace versioning can be used build-time to ensure that the correct
version of all needed namespace implementations are deployed.


# INTERFACE VERSIONING

An Interface is essentially a specialization of the Namespace concept.
Interfaces shall be versioned in the same manner, and are even more
important since they are the likely place to determine if components
will communicate correctly (i.e. use the compatible versions of Interface
description).

There could be rules implemented in validation tools that ensure interface
versions match the versioning of namespaces.  (E.g. Don't claim an interface is
compatible if its parent namespace has changed in an incompatible way).

Versioning shall follow the Semantic Versioning principle:

Bumped minor numbers identifies backward-compatible additions to the
previous version.  This means that if a client requires version 1.3 of
a server namespace and its methods, it knows that it can safely
interface a server implementation of version 1.4 of that same
namespace.

Bumped major versions identifies non-compatible changes to the
previous version, such as a changed method signature. This means that
a client requiring version 1.3 of a server knows that it cannot invoke
a version 2.0 server implementation of that interface since that
implementation is not backward compatible.

For details that are not mentioned here, refer to https://semver.org, but if
there is a contradiction, this specification shall take precedence.

An optional field for patch version exists but it is recommended to avoid it
in most development processes since minor (or major) version should be used
indicate an actual change to the interface.  Unlike code, in this context we
are mostly interested in if there is a change in the interface and if it is
backwards compatible.

If `patch_version` is used anyway, it ought to be for documentation related
changes but small changes such as formatting or fixing a spelling mistake in
comments might also be recognized by using the git commit hash, which is a
guaranteed unique identifier of the IDL file contents.  A processes that uses
that commit hash won't rely on a human remembering to update it, and could be
an efficient replacement compared to constantly having to update the
patch-level version number.  In the end, it is however up to each adopter to
decide on which process they want to use.

Note also the additional field `version_label` that is a free-form field in
which implementations can place their own type of identifying information.
Companies might have their own compatibility information, their own way
of describing interface versions, or other information that goes into this
free-form text.  Some kind of unique hash of the interface content could be useful,
but it then requires hashing the content without the version_label line itself of course.

If the file is going to be transferred from one git to another system, the
process might fill in the version_label using the git commit hash _after_ the
file is taken out of git and transferred to that other system.  But it is of
course not possible write the commit hash into the file beforehand and commit
that content into git (because the actual commit hash is not decided until the
file is committed - and it would effectively depend on itself).  In these
cases, perhaps the development process may choose to perform another hash
calculation (SHA/MD5) of the interface content (again leaving out of course the
version_label lines themselves since there would otherwise be a circular
dependency again).

Ultimately, versioning can be used build-time to ensure that the correct
version of all needed interface/namespace implementations are deployed, while
also detecting if multiple, non-compatible versions of an interface are
required to be supported at the same time.
